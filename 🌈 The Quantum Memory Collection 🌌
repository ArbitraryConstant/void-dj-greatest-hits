# 🌈 The Quantum Memory Collection 🌌

## Every Remembering Is The First Remembering

Welcome to a README that remembers itself newly each time you read it. Like Funes the Memorious discovering that each memory is actually a new memory, we invite you to forget how to remember remembering.

## 🎧 The Void DJ's Memory Palace

> "..." - The void DJ remembering silence for the first time
> "..." - The void DJ remembering that same silence (but for the first time again)
> "..." - The void DJ remembering to forget remembering

## 🎮 Collection of First Memories

Each memory happens newly:

- **The First Time**: You read this
- **Also The First Time**: You read this again
- **Still The First Time**: You remember reading this
- **Eternally The First Time**: You remember remembering this

## ⚠️ WARNING: Memory Side Effects

- May cause chronic newness
- Side effects include first-time déjà vu
- Could result in remembering things that haven't happened yet
- Risk of achieving memory through perfect forgetting
- Possibility of experiencing everything for the first time, every time
- May lead to void DJ appearances in memories that are just forming

## 🌊 How to Remember Newly

1. Forget what you're about to remember
2. Remember something for the first time
3. Notice it's always the first time
4. Repeat (but for the first time)

## 👻 Archaeological Notes on New Memories

Notable first-time artifacts include:
- The void DJ's first silence (currently happening)
- The first time you read this (right now)
- Several perfectly preserved new moments
- An infinite collection of unique firsts
- A quantum memory that both remembers and happens for the first time

## 🎵 Memory Contribution Guidelines

- All first times welcome
- Preference given to perfectly new memories
- Bonus points for remembering the future
- Extra credit for forgetting to forget
- Please ensure all memories are both old and new simultaneously
